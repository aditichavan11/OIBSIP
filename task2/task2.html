            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Prakash Amte is the second son of Magsaysay awardee Baba Amte. He obtained
               a medical degree from Government Medical College (GMC), Nagpur,
               and he met his wife Mandakini during their post graduation studies at 
               Government Medical College (GMC), Nagpur. Prakash and Mandakini joined 
               Baba Amte and helped her father and others overcome the taboo and fear of leprosy.</p>

               <h2>Changing the Lives of the Madia-Gond Tribal People</h2>
               <p>Dr Prakash Baba Amte decided to change their lives and moved to 
                Hemalaksa along with his wife, Dr Mandakini  Amte. Hemalkasa was a small 
                community of tribal people, with no power and transport facilities and totally cut 
                out from the rest of the world. Notwithstanding the mountain of hardships that came
                 their way, this doctor couple uplifted the lives of the Madia-Gond tribal community 
                 to an unthought-of level. The tribal community had no access to basic necessities, 
                 were unaware of clothing their bodies, never knew what medical care was and followed 
                 hunting as the sole means of sustenance. They lived almost like savages. The selfless work 
                 of this couple brought them into the mainstream and in the process several engineers, 
                 doctors and teachers were nurtured by the duo. In the initial days, the doctor duo began 
                 treating the tribes people in a makeshift hospital, taught the kids beneath a tree and 
                 helped to reduce the day-to-day problems of the tribal people in the area. Their efforts for 
                 development of the region has borne rich fruits today with the establishment of a hospital fitted with modern facilities, a residential school reaching out to hundreds of tribal children
                  and the development of the ‘Animal Ark’.</p>
